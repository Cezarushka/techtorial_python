#day =    "Saturday"
# 12345678 so the length of string day is 8
#->index   01234567     
#    # Indexing is location of the charachters in the string. And indexing
#   #always starts from 0
#  # How can we use the index numbers ? 
# #  # I want to get the 4th letter from the string day.   
# #  #index of letter 4 is 3
# To be able to extract the letter(charachter) using index we should use 
# [] (square brackets)
# Example ->    day[3] will give me the 4th letter from the string
