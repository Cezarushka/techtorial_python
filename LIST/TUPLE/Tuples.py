# Tuples:
# Immutable version of the list. 
# Syntax = tup = (1,2,3,4,5)
# ------------------------------------------------
# Tuples are ordered, unchangeable(immutable). 
# _________________________________________________
# print out all the elements of a given tuple. 

# tupl = (1,2,3,4,5)
# for element in tupl:
# 	print(element)
# It doesn't have methods like add, remove, clear etc. 
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Methods of a tuple.
# index() -> It will return index number of a 
# given value
# tupl = (1,2,3,4,5)
# print(tupl.index(3)) -> 2

# count() -> It will count how many times given 
# value repeated in the tuple. 

# print(tupl.count(4)) -> 1




#creating string with one element
s="s"

#creating list with one Elemen
l=[4]

#creating set with one element
se={"t"}

#creating tuple with one element you need to use a comma after the value

t=(3,)
print(type(t))
