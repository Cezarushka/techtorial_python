#Complex numbers are made of real number in this case 4 and imaginary number 
#in this case 2j

c = 4+2j


#complex numbers are calculated separately for example:
c =c/2
#in this case c=4, 4/2=2

print(c)
#the total will be 2+1j, because c was 4 and 4 /2 is 2 and then separately calculates 2j/ by2=1j



c =c-10
print(c)
#the total will be -8+1j, becasue c=2 from last operation but 
#you dont subtract from imaginary part

d = 10+5j
e = c+d
print(e)

# J means root of -1

# J is to represend imaginary number in python


#learning imaginary part and real part of the number
#following line will give you real part of the number
print(e.real)

#following line will give the imagiinary part of the number
print(e.imag)
